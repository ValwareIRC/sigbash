# sigbash
A bash script which plays Sigmally for you

Requires `xdotool`.

# Description

This script just moves your cursor around the screen and clicks buttons when you die to join the game again.

This script takes control of the cursor on your computer, so you cannot run this in the background. This is a kinda "leave your computer on overnight with this running" type of deal.

You should change `CONTINUEBUTTONX`, `CONTINUEBUTTONY`, `PLAYBUTTONX` and `PLAYBUTTONY` to match the the dimensions of your screen. This is currently set using the values of my own screen dimensions and assumes the browser is in full-screen mode.
